# GNNS

This repo is the authors' implementation of the GNN-style algorithm for community detection described in the paper 
"[Graph Neural Network Inspired Algorithm for Unsupervised Network Community Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02520)".

This paper proposes a new variant of the recurrent graph neural network algorithm for unsupervised network _community detection through modularity optimization_. The new algorithm's performance is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The approach also serves as a proof-of-concept for the broader application of recurrent graph neural networks to unsupervised network optimization.

[GNNS.ipynb](https://github.com/Alexander-Belyi/GNNS/blob/master/GNNS.ipynb) notebook is ready to be run in Google Colab. Just follow the link:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/Alexander-Belyi/GNNS/blob/master/GNNS.ipynb.
It should reproduce the results presented in the paper (enable the GPU backend to reproduce the running time figures).
